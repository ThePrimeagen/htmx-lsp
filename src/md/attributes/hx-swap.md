hx-swap

The hx-swap attribute allows you to specify how the response will be swapped in relative to the target of an AJAX request.

The possible values of this attribute are:

innerHTML - The default, replace the inner html of the target element
outerHTML - Replace the entire target element with the response
beforebegin - Insert the response before the target element
afterbegin - Insert the response before the first child of the target element
beforeend - Insert the response after the last child of the target element
afterend - Insert the response after the target element
delete - Deletes the target element regardless of the response
none- Does not append content from response (out of band items will still be processed).
These options are based on standard DOM naming and the Element.insertAdjacentHTML specification.

So in this code:

  <div hx-get="/example" hx-swap="afterend">Get Some HTML & Append It</div>
The div will issue a request to /example and append the returned content after the div

Modifiers
The hx-swap attributes supports modifiers for changing the behavior of the swap. They are outlined below.

Transition: transition
If you want to use the new View Transitions API when a swap occurs, you can use the transition:true option for your swap. You can also enable this feature globally by setting the htmx.config.globalViewTransitions config setting to true.

Timing: swap & settle
You can modify the amount of time that htmx will wait after receiving a response to swap the content by including a swap modifier:

  <!-- this will wait 1s before doing the swap after it is received -->
  <div hx-get="/example" hx-swap="innerHTML swap:1s">Get Some HTML & Append It</div>
Similarly, you can modify the time between the swap and the settle logic by including a settle modifier:

  <!-- this will wait 1s before doing the swap after it is received -->
  <div hx-get="/example" hx-swap="innerHTML settle:1s">Get Some HTML & Append It</div>
These attributes can be used to synchronize htmx with the timing of CSS transition effects.

Scrolling: scroll & show
You can also change the scrolling behavior of the target element by using the scroll and show modifiers, both of which take the values top and bottom:

  <!-- this fixed-height div will scroll to the bottom of the div after content is appended -->
  <div style="height:200px; overflow: scroll"
       hx-get="/example"
       hx-swap="beforeend scroll:bottom">
     Get Some HTML & Append It & Scroll To Bottom
  </div>
  <!-- this will get some content and add it to #another-div, then ensure that the top of #another-div is visible in the
       viewport -->
  <div hx-get="/example"
       hx-swap="innerHTML show:top"
       hx-target="#another-div">
    Get Some Content
  </div>
If you wish to target a different element for scrolling or showing, you may place a CSS selector after the scroll: or show:, followed by :top or :bottom:

  <!-- this will get some content and swap it into the current div, then ensure that the top of #another-div is visible in the
       viewport -->
  <div hx-get="/example"
       hx-swap="innerHTML show:#another-div:top">
    Get Some Content
  </div>
You may also use window:top and window:bottom to scroll to the top and bottom of the current window.

  <!-- this will get some content and swap it into the current div, then ensure that the viewport is scrolled to the
       very top -->
  <div hx-get="/example"
       hx-swap="innerHTML show:window:top">
    Get Some Content
  </div>
Focus scroll
htmx preserves focus between requests for inputs that have a defined id attribute. By default htmx prevents auto-scrolling to focused inputs between requests which can be unwanted behavior on longer requests when the user has already scrolled away. To enable focus scroll you can use focus-scroll:true.

  <input id="name" hx-get="/validation"
       hx-swap="outerHTML focus-scroll:true"/>
Alternatively, if you want the page to automatically scroll to the focused element after each request you can change the htmx global configuration value htmx.config.defaultFocusScroll to true. Then disable it for specific requests using focus-scroll:false.

  <input id="name" hx-get="/validation"
       hx-swap="outerHTML focus-scroll:false"/>
Notes
hx-swap is inherited and can be placed on a parent element
The default value of this attribute is innerHTML
Due to DOM limitations, itâ€™s not possible to use the outerHTML method on the <body> element. htmx will change outerHTML on <body> to use innerHTML.
The default swap delay is 0ms
The default settle delay is 20ms
