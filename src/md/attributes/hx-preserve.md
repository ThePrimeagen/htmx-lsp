The hx-preserve attribute allows you to keep an element unchanged during HTML replacement. Elements with hx-preserve set are preserved by id when htmx updates any ancestor element. You must set an unchanging id on elements for hx-preserve to work. The response requires an element with the same id, but its type and other attributes are ignored.

Note that some elements cannot unfortunately be preserved properly, such as <input type="text"> (focus and caret position are lost), iframes or certain types of videos. To tackle some of these cases we recommend the morphdom extension, which does a more elaborate DOM reconciliation.
Notes

    hx-preserve is not inherited
