The hx-swap-oob attribute allows you to specify that some content in a response should be swapped into the DOM somewhere other than the target, that is “Out of Band”. This allows you to piggy back updates to other element updates on a response.

Consider the following response HTML:

<div>
 ...
</div>
<div id="alerts" hx-swap-oob="true">
    Saved!
</div>

The first div will be swapped into the target the usual manner. The second div, however, will be swapped in as a replacement for the element with the id alerts, and will not end up in the target.

The value of the hx-swap-oob can be:

    true
    any valid hx-swap value
    any valid hx-swap value, followed by a colon, followed by a CSS selector

If the value is true or outerHTML (which are equivalent) the element will be swapped inline.

If a swap value is given, that swap strategy will be used.

If a selector is given, all elements matched by that selector will be swapped. If not, the element with an ID matching the new content will be swapped.
Notes

    hx-swap-oob is not inherited
    Out of band elements must be in the top level of the response, and not children of the top level elements.
