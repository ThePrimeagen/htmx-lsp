The hx-history-elt attribute allows you to specify the element that will be used to snapshot and restore page state during navigation. By default, the body tag is used. This is typically good enough for most setups, but you may want to narrow it down to a child element. Just make sure that the element is always visible in your application, or htmx will not be able to restore history navigation properly.

Here is an example:

<html>
  <body>
    <div id="content" hx-history-elt>
     ...
    </div>
  </body>
</html>

Notes

    hx-history-elt is not inherited
    In most cases we donâ€™t recommend narrowing the history snapshot
