The hx-confirm attribute allows you to confirm an action before issuing a request. This can be useful in cases where the action is destructive and you want to ensure that the user really wants to do it.

Here is an example:

<button hx-delete="/account" hx-confirm="Are you sure you wish to delete your account?">
  Delete My Account
</button>

Notes

    hx-confirm is inherited and can be placed on a parent element
