Alpine.js now has a lightweight morph plugin and this extension allows you to use it as the swapping mechanism in htmx which is necessary to retain Alpine state when you have entire Alpine components swapped by htmx.

Install
<script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org/dist/ext/alpine-morph.js"></script>

Usage
<header>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@latest"></script>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@latest/dist/ext/alpine-morph.js"></script>
  <!-- Alpine Plugins -->
  <script defer src="https://unpkg.com/@alpinejs/morph@3.x.x/dist/cdn.min.js"></script>
  <!-- Alpine Core -->
  <script defer src="https://unpkg.com/alpinejs@3.x.x/dist/cdn.min.js"></script>
</header>

<body>
    <div hx-target="this" hx-ext="alpine-morph" hx-swap="morph">
        <div x-data="{ count: 0, replaced: false,
                     message: 'Change me, then press the button!' }">
            <input type="text" x-model="message">
            <div x-text="count"></div>
            <button x-bind:style="replaced && {'backgroundColor': '#fecaca'}"
                  x-on:click="replaced = true; count++"
                  hx-get="/swap">
            Morph
            </button>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>

In the above example, all the Alpine x-data states (count, replaced, and message) are preserved even the entire Alpine component is swapped.

NOTE: /swap response from the example above should return actual element that is being replaced (this is <div hx-target="this"... element).
